<h2>Bundle Pipeline</h2>
<p>Bundles are processed in a pipleine that allows for easy modification. You can add in your own pipeline processing
to customize how a bundle is processed. There is one pipeline for style sheets and one for bundles. Each pipeline has default processors
used for the standard bundling procedure.</p>

<p>Default Processors for style sheet bundles (processed in this order):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Image path processor - updates any image paths to work with the new url.</li>
    <li>Minify processor - minifies the assets.</li>
    <li>Merge processor - merges the assets into one asset.</li>
</ul>

<p>Default Processors for script bundles (processed in this order):</p>
<ul>   
    <li>Minify processor - minifies the assets.</li>
    <li>Merge processor - merges the assets into one asset.</li>
</ul>
