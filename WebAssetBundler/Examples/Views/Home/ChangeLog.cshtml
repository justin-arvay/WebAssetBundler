    <h3>0.10.1 - Beta <span>Updated May 15 2013</span></h3>    
    <p>Breaking Changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>versionCssImages</strong> property has been removed from the WAB configuration section and 
        replaced with <strong>enableImagePipeline</strong>. If you do not want css images versioned, set enambleImagePipeline to false.</li>
        <li>Asset modifiers are no longer added to the asset but instead executed by a Modify method in the processor. </li>
        <li>The Content property in an asset has been renamed to a method called OpenStream.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Improvements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Added an ImagePipeline. When enabled css images are processed in a pipeline like scripts or style sheets. Plugins can also be used to 
        target the image pipeline.</li>
        <li>Add image rendering that takes advantage of the image pipeline. Useful for static images. Example: logos or icons.</li>
    </ul>
